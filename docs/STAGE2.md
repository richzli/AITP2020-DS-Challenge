#STAGE 2

Most of the work was done in Stage 1. When processing the file, any rows without a height or a tree density were removed. This ensures that we get a complete dataset.

We also decided to do the analysis only on the 10 most common trees. There are over 8000 tree IDs in the table, and it would be unreasonable to analyze every single species. The 10 most common types of trees should still show us important trends.

Code is in the Stage 1 writeup.
